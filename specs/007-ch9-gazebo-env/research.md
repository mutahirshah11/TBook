# Research for Chapter 9: Gazebo Simulation Environment Setup

This document will contain findings from research on ROS 2 and Gazebo compatibility, installation best practices, and relevant tools.

## Research Tasks:

-   **Research Task 1**: Determine the most appropriate and stable Gazebo version (e.g., Garden or Harmonic) to target for ROS 2 integration, considering ease of installation and current community support.
-   **Research Task 2**: Identify the specific ROS 2 distribution (e.g., Foxy, Humble, Iron) that offers the best compatibility and stability with the chosen Gazebo version and `ros_gz_sim` package.

## Findings:

-   **Gazebo Version**: Gazebo Garden (chosen for active development and recent features).
-   **ROS 2 Distribution**: ROS 2 Humble (chosen for its Long Term Support (LTS) status, wide adoption, and stability).
