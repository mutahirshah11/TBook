# Chapter 3 Outline Contract

**Target Audience**: Technical readers (CS/Engineering background) but new to robotics hardware.
**Reading Time**: ~15 minutes.

## Section 1: Introduction
- **Hook**: The transition from "Brain" (AI) to "Body" (Robot).
- **Purpose**: Why the physical form factor matters for Intelligence.
- **Scope**: Defining "Humanoid" (exclude pure manipulators or quadrupeds).

## Section 2: The Humanoid Taxonomy (The "What")
- **Subsection 2.1**: Locomotion
  - Bipeds vs. Wheeled-Bipeds.
  - The "Hybrid" argument.
- **Subsection 2.2**: Actuation (The Muscles)
  - The shift from stiff gears to "Back-drivability".
  - Why Proprioception matters for AI.
- **Subsection 2.3**: Sensors (The Senses)
  - LiDAR vs. Vision-Only (The Tesla debate).
  - Tactile sensing.

## Section 3: Historical Context (The "When")
- **Era 1**: The Static Era (Honda ASIMO).
  - Achievement: It could walk.
  - Limitation: It couldn't recover from a push.
- **Era 2**: The Dynamic Era (Boston Dynamics Atlas - Hydraulic).
  - Achievement: Parkour, backflips.
  - Limitation: Cost, complexity.
- **Era 3**: The AI Era (Modern Electric).
  - Achievement: Learning-based control, mass manufacturability.

## Section 4: The Industry Landscape (The "Who")
- **Map**: A 2x2 matrix concept (Research vs. Product x General vs. Specific).
- **Profiles**:
  - Tesla (Optimus)
  - Figure AI
  - Agility Robotics
  - Unitree
  - Sanctuary / 1X

## Section 5: Emerging Trends
- **Trend 1**: End-to-End Learning (Pixels to Torques).
- **Trend 2**: The price crash (Hardware becoming a commodity).
- **Trend 3**: Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).

## Section 6: Summary & Forward Link
- Recap key terms.
- Link to Chapter 4 (Simulation).
