# Chapter 5 Quickstart

## Title
**ROS 2 Architecture and Core Concepts**

## Abstract
This chapter bridges the gap between general robotics theory and practical ROS 2 implementation. It deconstructs the ROS 2 "Graph," explaining how Nodes communicate via Topics, Services, and Actions. It creates a mental model of the stack—from your Python code down to the DDS transport layer—empowering you to design modular, scalable robotic systems.

## Key Takeaways
1. **Nodes** are the executables; **Topics** are the streams.
2. **Services** are for quick questions; **Actions** are for long jobs.
3. **DDS** handles the magic of discovery and transport.
