# Quickstart for Chapter 11: Physics Simulation and Sensor Simulation

This document will provide a quick overview and practical steps for getting started with physics and sensor simulation in Gazebo, as covered in Chapter 11.

## Key Takeaways:

-   How to configure basic physics properties in a Gazebo world.
-   How to add and visualize a camera sensor on a simulated robot.

## Prerequisites:

-   A working ROS 2 environment (Humble recommended).
-   Gazebo Garden installed and integrated with ROS 2 (from Chapter 9).
-   Basic understanding of URDF/SDF (from Chapter 10).

## Example:

*(This section will contain a simple, runnable example demonstrating core concepts, such as a robot interacting with its environment and a simulated sensor publishing data to ROS 2.)*
