# Research for Chapter 11: Physics Simulation and Sensor Simulation

This document will contain findings from research on Gazebo physics engine configurations, sensor types and properties, and ROS 2 integration for simulated sensor data.

## Findings:

-   All content will be based on Gazebo Garden and ROS 2 Humble.
-   Official Gazebo and ROS 2 documentation will be the primary source of truth.
-   Community best practices will be considered for practical guidance.
