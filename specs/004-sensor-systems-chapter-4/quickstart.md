# Quickstart: Contributing to Chapter 4

**Goal**: Edit or verify the "Sensor Systems" chapter.

## Prerequisites
1.  **Repo Clone**: Ensure you have the repo cloned and dependencies installed.
2.  **Server**: Run `npm start`.

## Editing Content
-   **File**: `docs/part1/chapter4-sensor-systems.mdx` (To be created).
-   **Assets**: `static/img/chapter4/`.

## Verification Steps
1.  **Check Technical Accuracy**: Ensure distinction between "Exteroception" (world) and "Proprioception" (self) is clear.
2.  **Check Examples**: Ensure hardware examples (e.g., RealSense, Velodyne) are spelled correctly.
3.  **Check Flow**: Confirm the transition from individual sensors to "Fusion" feels natural.
