# Digital Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics (Docusaurus) Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy
All claims must be verified against primary sources whenever possible.

### Clarity
Writing must target Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12, clear for readers with a computer science or AI background.

### Reproducibility
All references, examples, and diagrams must be traceable.

### Rigor
MUST prioritize peer-reviewed or authoritative sources; ensure technical and scientific correctness.

### Integrity
Zero tolerance for plagiarism or fabricated content.

### Test-Driven Development
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a mandatory practice. Tests MUST be written before implementation, user-approved, and initially fail. A strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle MUST be enforced.

### Key Standards
- All factual claims must be traceable to sources.
- Citation format: APA style.
- Minimum 50% of sources must be peer-reviewed or authoritative.
- Writing clarity: Flesch-Kincaid grade 10-12; active voice ≥ 75%.
- Academic integrity: 0% plagiarism tolerance.
- Figures, tables, diagrams, and code snippets must be accurate, labeled, and verified.
- Digital formatting: Markdown compatible with Docusaurus; all hyperlinks, images, and embeds must function correctly.

## Constraints

- Word count: flexible per chapter but must meet book standards.
- Format: Markdown for Docusaurus deployment.
- All work must comply with the Constitution; no deviation allowed.

## Testing & Verification

- Verify all claims against authoritative sources.
- Run plagiarism check on all content before publication.
- Check readability scores and active voice percentage.
- Review diagrams, tables, figures, and code snippets for accuracy and proper labeling.
- Validate all Markdown links, images, and embeds in Docusaurus preview.

## Governance

- **Amendment Process**: Amendments to this constitution MUST follow a formal review and approval process, documented with rationale.
- **Compliance Review**: Adherence to these constitutional principles MUST be reviewed regularly (e.g., quarterly) to ensure ongoing alignment and effectiveness.
- **Enforcement**: All contributors are responsible for upholding these principles. Violations will be addressed through established project governance procedures.
