## Prompt

/sp.clarify

## Response snapshot

Engaged in a clarification session, addressing 5 key ambiguities regarding the Qdrant vector setup, including the specific Cohere model, distance metric, chunking strategy, idempotency, and chunk overlap.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Clarified technical details essential for implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Updated specs/014-qdrant-book-vectors/spec.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with implementation based on the plan and tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully guided user through critical technical decisions for the vector pipeline.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): default
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
