## Prompt

/sp.plan

## Response snapshot

Generated implementation plan, research findings, data model, algorithm contracts, and quickstart guide for Part 5.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established robust technical strategy for humanoid development using Pinocchio and Talos.
- 🧪 Tests: Defined "Hello World" verification for Pinocchio installation.
- 📁 Files: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/.
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Research phase confirmed the viability of `example-robot-data` and `conda-forge` for a smooth user experience.
