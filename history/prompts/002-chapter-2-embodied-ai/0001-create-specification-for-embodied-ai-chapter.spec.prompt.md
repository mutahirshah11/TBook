## Prompt

Part: Part 1 Chapter: Chapter 2 — From digital AI to robots that understand physical laws - Define the purpose and role of Chapter 2 within Part 1 - Explain how this chapter expands on Chapter 1 and transitions from abstract digital AI to embodied, physics-aware AI. - Identify the essential ideas the chapter should explore (e.g., digital vs. physical constraints, embodiment, understanding forces, motion, energy, dynamics). - Allow yourself to propose any additional concepts that strengthen the chapter’s learning goals. - List clear learning outcomes for the reader. - Provide only light, natural boundaries to keep the chapter focused (avoid implementation details, frameworks, or engineering specifics).

## Response snapshot

Created specification for Chapter 2, covering Embodied AI, Physical Laws, and reader learning outcomes. Validated with checklist.
