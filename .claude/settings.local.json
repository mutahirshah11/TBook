Ingest every Markdown/MDX file from the docs/ folder of the existing book, split into meaningful chunks, and make the entire book searchable.\n2. Provide a persistent chat widget visible on every page of the book.\n3. Answer any question about the book''s content accurately using only the book as source.\n4. Support \"selected-text\" mode: when the user highlights any text on a page and clicks \"Ask about this selection\", the chatbot answers using ONLY the selected text plus relevant retrieved chunks from the book — never using external knowledge.\n5. Stream responses in real time.\n6. Maintain conversation history across pages for the same browser session.\n7. Work perfectly with the current Vercel-hosted Docusaurus site (no changes to hosting required).\n8. Include a one-time ingestion script to run whenever the book content updates.\n9. Be secure: no API keys exposed in the browser.\n\nNon-functional Requirements:\n- Use only free-tier services where possible.\n- Response latency under 2 seconds for typical queries.\n- Support concurrent users.\n\nDeliverables:\n- Complete backend API\n- One-time ingestion script\n- Single React component + floating widget button to drop into existing Docusaurus project\n- Step-by-step instructions to add the widget to the current Vercel-deployed book\n- Full README with setup, env vars, ingestion, and deployment\")",

The goal is to allow readers to interact naturally with the book''s content and receive accurate, context-aware answers.\n\n## Features\n- **Embedded Chat Interface**: The chatbot is fully integrated within the book and accessible as a floating interface at the right bottom corner, without disrupting the reading experience.\n- **Scrollable Conversation View**: Displays the full chat history with clear distinction between user messages and AI responses.\n- **User Input Area**: Provides a clear input box where users can type questions, with a dedicated send action for submitting queries.\n- **Real-Time Response Streaming**: AI responses appear incrementally as they are generated, providing users with a responsive and dynamic conversation experience.\n- **Visual Differentiation**: User messages and AI responses are visually distinct, using different styles, colors, or alignment for clarity.\n- **RAG Chatbot Initialization**: The RAG AI agent is initialized automatically when the chat interface loads, ensuring it is ready to retrieve context from the book and answer queries immediately.\n- **Session Management**: Each conversation is tracked independently to maintain context across multiple queries, allowing users to have distinct, continuous chat sessions.\n- **Selected Text Queries**: Users can highlight text in the book and submit it along with their question, allowing the chatbot to focus on specific sections for more accurate, context-aware answers.\n- **Responsive Design**: The chat interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.\n- **Thematic Consistency**: The chat interface aligns with the book''s theme and design, supporting both light and dark modes, and maintaining a cohesive visual style.\n- **Accessibility**: The UI ensures readable text, keyboard navigability, and clarity for users with diverse accessibility needs.\n- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: The chat UI and its interaction features must follow TDD principles, ensuring correctness, reliability, and maintainability\")"
